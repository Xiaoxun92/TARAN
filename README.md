# TARAN Precision Enhanced
This is a fork of the original [TARAN](https://guns.ptosis.ch/taran-en) project to better support airgun use cases, which typically involve the following characteristics:
1. They can occur at extremely short distances.
2. They exhibit relatively smaller spreads between impact points when compared to bullet diameters, often resulting in significant overlap between bullet holes.

The changes include:
1. Improved dynamic scaling of visual elements to address various issues when bullet holes are extremely close, such as thick lines and other potential visual artifacts.
2. Added a toggle feature for switching between full, transparent, and center-only bullet hole display modes to prevent overcrowding and obstruction.
3. Enhanced compatibility for smaller numerical values throughout the codebase, including shorter distances, smaller calibers, and increased precision in decimal digits, among other related improvements.
4. Introduced keyboard shortcuts and visual refinements to enhance the bullet hole addition screen.
5. Implemented various quality-of-life improvements.
